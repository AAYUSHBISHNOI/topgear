        <p>
          A Float Van Campaign is a creative and mobile marketing technique
          where a branded vehicle, typically a van or truck, is decorated with
          eye-catching visuals and used to promote a brand, product, or service
          while moving through high-traffic areas or parking at strategic
          locations.
