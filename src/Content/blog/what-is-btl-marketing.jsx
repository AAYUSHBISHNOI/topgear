      <p className="mb-4">
        BTL (Below The Line) Marketing refers to marketing strategies focused on
        engaging directly with targeted customers using personal and measurable
        methods. Unlike ATL (Above The Line) tactics that reach mass audiences
        through television, print, or radio, BTL campaigns are more targeted and
        interactive — fostering stronger emotional connections and higher ROI.

        Understanding the Shift: ATL vs. BTL
      </h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        ATL marketing uses broad channels like national TV, newspapers, or
        digital banners to create brand awareness on a large scale. While
        effective for mass outreach, it often lacks personalization and
        precision.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        BTL, on the other hand, is more personal and interactive. Whether it’s
        an{" "}

          in-store activation

        speak directly to their niche audience, track interactions, and adapt in
        real time.

        Why BTL Marketing Works in the Digital Age
      </h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        In an era where consumers are bombarded with thousands of ads every day,
        BTL offers something different — a <strong>memorable experience</strong>
        . With face-to-face interaction, live demonstrations, and experiential
        setups, brands can cut through the noise and leave a stronger
        impression.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Moreover, BTL campaigns complement digital efforts perfectly. Combining
        physical experiences with QR codes, mobile apps, or live social media
        integrations enhances reach while maintaining intimacy.

        BTL marketing is not just a supplement to ATL — it’s a powerful strategy
        in its own right. In an era of hyper-personalization and shrinking
        attention spans, BTL allows your brand to stand out through experience,
        engagement, and emotional connection.
